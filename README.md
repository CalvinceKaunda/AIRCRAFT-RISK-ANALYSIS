## Overview
 This analysis is intended to find an aircraft wit lowest risk.

 A company is interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprices.
 They are new to the industry and do not know the risk. They would like an aircraft with lowest risk 
 to start their business endevour.

The data is from kaggle:  kaggle.com/datasets/khsamaha/aviation-accident-database-synopses and 
conatins information about aviation accidents and incidents in the U.S and its environs

Hence, I would recommend Airplanes for entry into business as this is the aircraft with the highest number of non fatalities, hence quite safe for consumers.
The risk being considered here is in terms of the non-fatalities

If the risk being considered is in terms of damages I would reccommend balloons as the have the least
